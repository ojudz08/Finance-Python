# Finance-Python

About: Finance and Python is an online course website that teaches both Finance and Python. Through their "learning by doing" model, they teach actual concepts, work through examples and explain it thoroughly (even non-programmers or finance majors will understand their topic very easily). 

This repository contains all the examples, activities and challenges from Finance and Python which I did.

Disclaimer: The code is not fully owned by me as I only modified or edited the codes to understand the topic discussed.
